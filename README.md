# Rhythm Framework

Rhythm Framework is a package that speeds up development with AI agents in phython by providing built-in agents (Robots) and integration classes for easier API interations. This allows users to build complex systems based on the ALAN (Autonomous layered AI network) technology in no time and start to automate their life today. ALAN technology allows linking multiple AI systems together in a net based structure and ensure cooperation between them to work towards a greater goal and push the limits of what AI can do.
